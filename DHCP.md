<h1> Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) </h1>
<br/>
<p>-  is a network management protocol used to automatically assign IP addresses and other communication parameters to devices connected to a network using a client-server architecture. It eliminates the need for manually configuring network devices and consists of two network components: a centrally installed network DHCP server and client instances of the protocol stack on each computer or device. DHCP automates and centrally manages these configurations, allowing devices to use network services such as DNS, NTP, and any communication protocol based on UDP or TCP. When a device wants access to a network using DHCP, it sends a request for an IP address that is picked up by a DHCP server.  </p>
