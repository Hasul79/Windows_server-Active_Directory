# DHCP

 Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network management protocol 
used to automatically assign IP addresses and other communication parameters to 
devices connected to a network using a client-server architecture. It eliminates the 
need for manually configuring network devices and consists of two network 
components: a centrally installed network DHCP server and client instances of the 
protocol stack on each computer or device. DHCP automates and centrally manages 
these configurations, allowing devices to use network services such as DNS, NTP, 
and any communication protocol based on UDP or TCP. When a device wants access 
to a network using DHCP, it sends a request for an IP address that is picked up by a 
DHCP server
